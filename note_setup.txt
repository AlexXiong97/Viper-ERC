Environment:

Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (MacOS works similarly I would imagine)

NOTE:
# DON'T Panic if Installation/Set-up fails, take a deep breath and follow me.

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y upgrade
python3 -V  => Python 3.5.2

# you need python3.6 or later.
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jonathonf/python-3.6
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip
sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python-dev python3.6-dev python3.6

pip3 install setuptools

#before testing, make sure you have pyethereum clone on branch state_revamp
git clone https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum/
git checkout state_revamp
python3.6 setup.py install / python setup.py install (both work)

# There is a bug in `viper/tests/test_parser.py`, change `tester2` into `tester`

# Now, we are talking business (python3.6 or later is necessary)
python3.6 setup.py install
python3.6 setup.py test
